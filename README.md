# rock_paper_scissors

Rock paper scissors played against the computer.

The first iteration of this project had only a basic UI where prompt() was used to get player input. The result of the game was output to the console; there was minimal HTML and no CSS.

The second iteration had a UI where the player could click an icon on screen to choose their preferred 'weapon'. Player and computer lives were represented by heart icons on screen which disappeared when a round was lost. A game was considered to be finished when the player or computer had lost all their lives.
